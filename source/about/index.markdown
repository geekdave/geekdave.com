{% img left http://www.geekdave.com/static/me.jpg Dave Cadwallader %}

My name is Dave Cadwallader, and I'm a software engineer living in Evergreen, Colorado with my wife and newborn son.

By day, I'm employed as an Architect in the User Experience group at [Model N](http://www.modeln.com/), based in Redwood City, California. Â Note that the views expressed in this blog are my own, and not necessarily those of my employer.

I enjoy writing about JavaScript frameworks, best practices, and large-scale architecture.

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy cooking, playing the drums, and exploring the Rocky Mountains by foot, bike, and snowshoe.
